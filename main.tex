\section{Architecture, Infrastructure, and Platform}

\subsection{Architecture}
\noindent The inventory system has been implemented using the MEAN stack and Twitter Bootstrap for styling. The MEAN stack is a popular full stack Javascript framework. The MEAN stack + Bootstrap is comprised of the following components:
\begin{itemize}
\item MongoDB: An open source, cross platform, document oriented, flexible, NoSQL database. Objects are stored in a human readable JSON-like format.
\item Express: A Node.js web application server framework that enables the use of the MVC design pattern.
\item AngularJS: A client-side front end framework that includes directives, dependency injection, and two-way data binding
\item Node.js: A JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine.
\item Twitter Bootstrap: A framework for developing responsive, mobile oriented web applications

\subsection{Infrastructure}

\item Project Hosting:
 https://github.com/Lmasniuk/PetStoreInventory

\item Installing/Running the application: \\
Node and NPM must be installed on a machine in order to install and run the web application. Type the following commands into a CLI in order to install and run the current version of the application:
\begin{verbatim}
git clone https://github.com/Lmasniuk/PetStoreInventory.git
cd PetStoreInventory
npm install
npm start
open http://0.0.0.0:8000/
\end{verbatim}

\item Data Serialization:
The inventory system contains many inventory items. Each item consists of several attributes such as id, name, price, etc. Each item is stored as a document(equivalent to a row in a SQL table) into an instance of MongoDB. Inside the MongoDB instance, the collection of items are stored in BSON format. When a client accesses the web application, an http request is made to the server to get all the items in the database. The server then retrieves the items, converts them into JSON format, and then sends an http response back containing all items in JSON format. The client can then access and display the items. 


\subsection{Platform}

A live version of the application is hosted on Heroku\\
https://petstore-inventory.herokuapp.com/

\section{Implementation Details}
\noindent The current codebase is organized in a Model/View/Controller design pattern.

\subsection{View}
\noindent The view consists of two HTML pages: item-detail and item-list. In angular, these HTML dependencies are called `partials', and can be stored in separate files and included as needed to complete a template.

\hspace{1mm}

\noindent There is also an index.html file that acts as a container for the two partials. Within the index, item-list is included using the ngInclude directive, which simply includes an external HTML fragment. The item-detail view, however, is included using ngView, so it can be dynamically changed depending on the current route (which is controlled using the built in routeProvider service). This is to allow the item detail view to be changed on the fly through the user interface.

\vspace{2mm}
\noindent {\it index.html}
\vspace{-3mm}\begin{verbatim}
<div ng-include="`views/item-list.html'"
    ng-controller="itemListController">
</div>
<div ng-view></div>
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Model}
\noindent The model, which is essentially the entity class, is an Angular service; it can be injected as a dependency and used by any controller wishing to GET data from or PUT data to the store. Currently, the data is hardcoded in a javascript array, but in the future the service will make an HTTP call to retrieve the data from the server. The service uses a factory function that generates instances of the service to the rest of the application.

\noindent We use the following factory named ``Item":

\vspace{2mm}
\noindent {\it itemService.js}
\vspace{-3mm}\begin{verbatim}
angular.module(`itemService', []).factory(`Item',
function() { ... })}
\end{verbatim}

\noindent In the future, using regular javascript prototypal inheritance, we can create another factory to extend the original. For example:

\vspace{-3mm}\begin{verbatim}
angular.module(`itemService', []).factory(`specificItem',
function(Item) { ... })}
\end{verbatim}


\noindent In this example, the factory named ``specificItem" uses the original Item factory as a dependency, inheriting its object prototype. As the app grows, this pattern allows us to avoid code reuse, separate concerns, and facilitate testing.

\subsection{Controller}
\noindent The app contains an itemListController and itemDetailController.  Each controller contains its own \$scope object, which is essentially the public API used by the view. In other words, any DOM element with the ng-controller attribute will have access to that controller's \$scope, and all of its child nodes as well. The item list controller manages state such as the order of the listed items (orderProp) and the the currently selected item (selectedItemId).

\vspace{2mm}
\noindent {\it mainCtrl.js}
\vspace{-3mm}\begin{verbatim}
angular.module(`mainCtrl',
[`itemService']).controller(`itemListController',
function($scope, Item) 
{
  $scope.orderProp = `date_added';
  $scope.selectedItemId = -1;
}); 
}
\end{verbatim}

\section{Git}
The code for this assignment uses git for version control. The repository is
hosted on github.  Using git allowed us to maintain an organized history of the project's evolution.  All group members worked on separate branches. Whenever we made a commit, we would push the work to the master branch which is the main trunk of the project. Gits automatic merging algorithms makes pulling a branch that has diverged from our own much easier.

\section{Testing}
The unit tests for the application were created using the Mocha unit testing framework.  Mocha provides functions such as \texttt{describe} and \texttt{equal} to facilitate unit testing. We also used the Karma program for running the unit tests because mocha js does not provide test running capabilities. Karma requires a test runner which is generally a web browser to run your tests.  For this, we used PhantomJS which is a headless ``browser'' written in javascript so that tests could be run without starting up an actual web browser.  We created four unit tests.  Two of the tests involve testing http requests.  Instead of making actual http requests in our unit tests, we mocked http responses with objects that are the same structure as what our server would actually respond with.  The other two unit tests test the behavior of selecting an item.

\begingroup
    \fontsize{10pt}{12pt}\selectfont
\vspace{-3mm}\begin{verbatim}
describe('inventory app controllers', function(){
  beforeEach(module('inventoryApp'));
  // beforeEach(module('itemService'));

  describe('itemListController', function(){
    var scope, ctrl, $httpBackend;

    beforeEach(inject(function(_$httpBackend_, $rootScope, $controller) {
      $httpBackend = _$httpBackend_;
      $httpBackend.expectGET('/api/items/').
        respond([{name: 'a'}, {name: 'b'}]);

      scope = $rootScope.$new();
      ctrl = $controller('itemListController', {$scope: scope});
    }));


    it('should create "items" model with 2 items fetched from xhr', function() {
      expect(scope.items).toEqual(undefined);
      $httpBackend.flush();
      expect(scope.items).toEqual([{name: 'a'}, {name: 'b'}]);
    });

    it('should update selectedItemId', function() {
      scope.selectItem({_id: 5});
      expect(scope.selectedItemId).toBe(5);
    });


    it('should have no item selected at the initial state', function() {
      expect(scope.selectedItemId).toBe(-1);
    });

  });
  \endgroup

\end{verbatim}


\section{Documentation}
Documentation was generated using the program \texttt{yuidoc}.  Yuidoc is an automatic documentation generator designed specifically for javascript code.  It outputs a website containing documentation generated from specialized comments it finds in the project source tree. Here is a screenshot of the documentation generated by Yuidoc.
